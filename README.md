# Base Camp
##### Here's my source code for Base's Base Camp, a guide to learning smart contract development. You can find everything in the `contracts` folder, separated by Exercises and Lessons.

##### The `Lessons` are where you'll find the code to earn the NFTs at the end of each section.

##### Solidity Compilation changes often so the versioning (0.8.17 - 0.8.23) may cause some issues during some of the sections but that's just part of the developer experience.

##### Feel free to use this as a reference or copy + paste. It is open-source 🤷🏽‍♂️
